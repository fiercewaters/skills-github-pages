I don't have any experience building a modern website.

I want to learn.  I don't think it needs to be hard, but the world is advancing very rapidly and its hard to keep up.  New tools are being developed all the time that are supposed to be better and easier than the old ones.  However, learning every new tools starts at zero. This results is a jagged learning profile over time.
